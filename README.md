# WhiteHats-Management-Application

### 1) Name
Muskan Srivastava

### 2) Why I want to join WhiteHats
I want to join the WhiteHats Management Team because I am passionate about the intersection of technology and community building. Having followed the chapter's work at VIT, I've seen the impact of your workshops and CTFs first-hand. 

As a management member, I aim to:
Use my organizational skills to ensure events run seamlessly.
Help connect technical concepts with the wider student body through creative outreach.
Contribute to the premier cybersecurity hub on campus while refining my leadership and project management capabilities.

### 3) Recent Cybersecurity Incident: The 2024 UnitedHealth Ransomware Attack
I recently read about the massive cyberattack on a unit of UnitedHealth Group. 
 An affiliate of the 'BlackCat' (ALPHV) ransomware group used compromised credentials to gain access to the system, which lacked Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). 
It wasn't just a data breach; it paralyzed the U.S. healthcare payment system for weeks, affecting pharmacies and hospitals nationwide. It serves as a critical reminder that even the largest organizations can fall victim to "basic" security lapses like missing MFA, and that cybersecurity is a matter of public safety, not just data privacy.
